# Value Mutability

Values stored in ZoneTree should be treated as snapshots.

This matters when `TValue` is a mutable reference type. While a value is still in an in-memory segment, ZoneTree may hold the same object reference the application inserted. Mutating that object outside a ZoneTree write can change the visible value without a WAL record, without a new operation index, and without a durable update.

## Shared Reference Hazard

```csharp
public sealed class User
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

var user = new User { Name = "Alice" };

zoneTree.Upsert(1, user);

user.Name = "Bob"; // mutates an object that may already be stored by reference
```

A value returned by `TryGet` should also be treated as a snapshot:

```csharp
if (zoneTree.TryGet(1, out var user))
{
    user.Name = "Bob"; // no ZoneTree write happens here
}
```

The behavior can differ depending on whether the value came from the mutable segment, a read-only segment, or disk deserialization. That difference makes shared mutation hard to reason about.

## Update Discipline

Create the next value and write it through ZoneTree:

```csharp
public sealed record UserSnapshot(string Name);

if (zoneTree.TryGet(1, out var user))
{
    var updated = user with { Name = "Bob" };
    zoneTree.Upsert(1, updated);
}
```

For mutable classes, clone before changing the value:

```csharp
if (zoneTree.TryGet(1, out var user))
{
    var updated = user.Clone();
    updated.Name = "Bob";
    zoneTree.Upsert(1, updated);
}
```

## Value Shapes

Small record-like payloads are often a good fit for structs or readonly record structs:

```csharp
public readonly record struct CounterValue(long Count);

public readonly record struct UserScore(int Score, long UpdatedAt);

public readonly record struct QueuePointer(long Sequence);
```

These shapes give value semantics, reduce accidental shared mutation, reduce GC pressure in in-memory segments, and serialize compactly when paired with appropriate serializers.

Reference types are still valid for large or complex values. Prefer immutable classes, records, serialized payloads, or clone-and-upsert patterns.

## Atomic Delegates

Atomic update delegates receive a local `TValue` variable by `ref`. They are the controlled place where a value can be transformed as part of a ZoneTree write.

For value types, this is direct. For mutable reference types, in-place mutation is valid when the delegate commits by returning `true`.

The cancellation case is the trap. Returning `false` tells ZoneTree not to write the local value back. If the delegate mutates a shared reference object before returning `false`, the object may already have changed in memory.

Decide first, then mutate or assign:

```csharp
zoneTree.TryAtomicGetAndUpdate(1, out var user, (ref UserSnapshot value) =>
{
    if (!ShouldRename(value))
        return false;

    value = value with { Name = "Bob" };
    return true;
});
```

In-place mutation is fine when the update is definitely committed:

```csharp
zoneTree.TryAtomicGetAndUpdate(1, out var user, (ref User value) =>
{
    if (!ShouldRename(value))
        return false;

    value.Name = "Bob";
    return true;
});
```

Returning `false` should mean the delegate made no observable change.
