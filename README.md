# ZoneTree

**The engine beneath serious .NET data systems.**

ZoneTree is a high-performance storage engine for ordered, persistent data. It is built for teams creating databases, indexes, search systems, queues, event stores, local-first applications, and custom data platforms in the .NET ecosystem.

## The missing layer

Modern data systems are not built on features alone.
They are built on storage layers that shape performance, reliability, and product architecture.

.NET has excellent databases and frameworks, but very few native storage engines that can be used as a foundation for building new data systems.

ZoneTree fills that layer.

It gives .NET systems a fast, programmable foundation for ordered data that must be written quickly, read predictably, persisted reliably, and shaped around the product instead of forcing the product into a fixed database model.

---

## What ZoneTree provides

ZoneTree gives you the core pieces expected from a serious storage engine:

* Ordered key-value storage
* High-throughput writes
* Persistent storage
* Write-ahead logging
* Configurable durability/performance trade-offs
* Forward and reverse iterators
* Seekable range scans
* Atomic read-modify-write operations
* Optimistic transactions
* Custom serializers
* Custom comparers
* Background maintenance and compaction
* In-memory and disk-backed operation
* Memory-conscious operation for datasets larger than RAM
* MIT licensed open source

ZoneTree can be used directly as an ordered key-value database, or as the storage foundation for higher-level systems.

---

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package ZoneTree
```

---

## Quick start

```csharp
using ZoneTree;

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, string>()
    .SetDataDirectory("data/my-zone-tree")
    .OpenOrCreate();

zoneTree.Upsert(1, "Hello ZoneTree");

if (zoneTree.TryGet(1, out var value))
{
    Console.WriteLine(value);
}
```

---

## Ordered iteration

ZoneTree stores keys in order. This makes it suitable for indexes, prefix layouts, time-series patterns, range scans, and custom data models.

```csharp
using var iterator = zoneTree.CreateIterator();

iterator.Seek(100);

while (iterator.Next())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{iterator.CurrentKey}: {iterator.CurrentValue}");
}
```

Reverse iteration is also supported:

```csharp
using var iterator = zoneTree.CreateReverseIterator();

iterator.Seek(1000);

while (iterator.Next())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{iterator.CurrentKey}: {iterator.CurrentValue}");
}
```

---

## Atomic add or update

ZoneTree provides atomic operations for read-modify-write scenarios across LSM-tree segments.

```csharp
zoneTree.TryAtomicAddOrUpdate(
    key: 42,
    valueToAdd: 1,
    valueUpdater: (ref int value) =>
    {
        value++;
        return true;
    },
    result: (in int value, long opIndex, OperationResult result) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{result}: {value} at {opIndex}");
    });
```

Plain `Upsert` is the fastest write path. Atomic methods are synchronized with other atomic methods and are intended for operations that must read, decide, and write as one logical action.

For normal concurrent writes, use the regular write APIs. They are designed for high-throughput use. Choose atomic methods only when the new value depends on the existing value.

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Set or replace a value | `Upsert` |
| Add only if the key does not exist | `TryAdd` |
| Delete a key if it exists | `TryDelete` |
| Write a deletion marker without checking existence | `ForceDelete` |
| Increment, append, compare-and-set, or update from the current value | Atomic methods |
| Coordinate changes across multiple keys | Transactions |

You can mix these write modes in the same ZoneTree. For example, hot counter keys can use atomic read-modify-write operations, while ordinary records continue to use fast `Upsert`. This lets each workflow pay only for the coordination it needs.

---

## Transactions

For coordinated multi-key changes, open a transactional ZoneTree.

```csharp
using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, string>()
    .SetDataDirectory("data/transactional-zone-tree")
    .OpenOrCreateTransactional();

var tx = zoneTree.BeginTransaction();

zoneTree.Upsert(tx, 1, "first");
zoneTree.Upsert(tx, 2, "second");

var result = zoneTree.PrepareAndCommit(tx);

Console.WriteLine(result);
```

Use transactions when your data model requires coordination across multiple keys. For simple high-throughput writes, the non-transactional API is usually the better path.

---

## Deletions

ZoneTree uses deletion markers. This is common in LSM-tree based storage engines: a delete is written first, and obsolete data is removed later during compaction.

For many primitive and nullable types, ZoneTree can provide default deletion behavior. You can also define your own delete marker.

The same mechanism can be used for TTL-style records. Store an expiration timestamp in the value, and make the delete predicate return `true` when the value has expired. ZoneTree will treat expired records like deleted records, and maintenance/compaction can remove obsolete data later.

```csharp
using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, int>()
    .SetDataDirectory("data/deletable")
    .SetIsDeletedDelegate((in int key, in int value) => value == -1)
    .SetMarkValueDeletedDelegate((ref int value) => value = -1)
    .OpenOrCreate();

zoneTree.Upsert(42, 100);
zoneTree.TryDelete(42, out var opIndex);
```

If your database does not need deletions and you want to store default values normally, deletion can be disabled:

```csharp
using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, int>()
    .DisableDeletion()
    .OpenOrCreate();
```

---

## Maintenance

ZoneTree uses an LSM-tree architecture. Writes first enter a mutable segment and are later moved, merged, and compacted into persistent segments.

For long-running applications, use the maintainer to run background maintenance.

```csharp
using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, string>()
    .SetDataDirectory("data/app")
    .OpenOrCreate();

using var maintainer = zoneTree.CreateMaintainer();

zoneTree.Upsert(1, "value");

// Before shutdown, wait for background work if needed.
maintainer.WaitForBackgroundThreads();
```

Maintenance behavior can be tuned for different workloads.

---

## Memory usage

ZoneTree is designed for datasets larger than memory. It does not need to load the whole database into RAM.

Memory usage mainly comes from the active mutable segment, frozen in-memory segments waiting for merge, disk block cache, sparse indexes, iterators that pin active segments, and temporary buffers used during merge or WAL processing.

The most important write-side memory control is the mutable segment size. By default, ZoneTree starts moving a mutable segment toward disk after 1 million records. This is a good default for small keys and values, but applications storing large strings, documents, or payload objects should lower the mutable segment record limit to keep memory usage predictable.

ZoneTree is built as a native .NET storage engine and uses the .NET garbage collector as part of its design. The GC is highly optimized for modern application workloads and helps keep ZoneTree simple, safe, and fast without requiring manual memory management.

When observing memory usage, remember that .NET may keep freed memory available for reuse instead of returning it to the operating system immediately. Process memory can remain high even after segments are merged or released, so use .NET memory diagnostics when you need to measure live ZoneTree data precisely.

```csharp
using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, string>()
    .SetDataDirectory("data/app")
    .SetMutableSegmentMaxItemCount(10_000)
    .OpenOrCreate();
```

For read-heavy workloads, memory is mostly shaped by cache behavior and the active working set. For write-heavy workloads, memory is mostly shaped by mutable segment size and how quickly maintenance can move frozen segments to disk.

---

## Durability and storage

ZoneTree persists data through disk segments and write-ahead logs. Recent writes enter the mutable segment and are protected according to the configured WAL mode. Maintenance later moves and merges data into disk segments.

Choose the WAL mode based on what the data means to your application.

| Need | Consider |
| --- | --- |
| Strongest ZoneTree WAL durability | Sync WAL |
| Strong durability with compressed WAL files | Sync compressed WAL |
| Very high write throughput with background WAL writes | Async compressed WAL |
| Rebuildable/cache data | No WAL |

Disk segments can also use compression and different segment layouts. These options help tune disk space, read patterns, merge behavior, and file-size boundaries.

---

## Performance

ZoneTree is built for high-throughput workloads.

The repository includes benchmark results covering large insert, load, merge, and iteration scenarios across different key/value types and write-ahead log modes.

In the included insert benchmarks, ZoneTree performs significantly faster than RocksDB on the tested workloads.

| **str-str RocksDb sync-compressed WAL**   | 8215 ms | 16146 ms | 23760 ms | 72491 ms |

Performance depends on workload and configuration, including:

* key and value types
* serializers
* comparer behavior
* write-ahead log mode
* compression settings
* mutable segment size
* disk segment mode
* storage hardware
* merge and maintenance configuration

## What can be built with ZoneTree?

ZoneTree is designed from the ground up as a storage-engine foundation for scalable systems. It is not a distributed database by itself; instead, it provides the ordered keyspace, durability controls, iterators, operation indexes, transactions, and maintenance hooks needed to build partitioned, replicated, or domain-specific data platforms above it.

It can power:

* custom databases
* indexing layers
* full-text search engines
* document stores
* graph stores
* event stores
* time-series storage
* persistent queues
* local-first data layers
* specialized storage systems
* server-side data platforms

The engine provides the ordered, persistent core; your product defines the model above it.
